# Machine Learning Models in this Repository

Machine learning (ML) involves the use of mathematical models to make predictions or decisions based on data. This repository includes implementations and examples of various machine learning models. The choice of model depends on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Here are some common mathematical models used in machine learning:

## Linear Regression

**Model:** \(y = mx + b\)

**Objective:** Predict a continuous output variable (\(y\)) based on one or more input features (\(x\)).

## Logistic Regression

**Model:** \(P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(mx + b)}}\)

**Objective:** Binary classification, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to class 1.

## Decision Trees

A tree-like model with nodes representing decisions based on features.

**Objective:** Classification or regression based on a series of decisions.

## Random Forest

Ensemble of decision trees.

**Objective:** Improve accuracy and control overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Model:** \(f(x) = \langle w, x \rangle + b\)

**Objective:** Find the hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space.

## Neural Networks

Various architectures, including feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks.

**Objective:** Learn complex patterns and representations from data.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Model:** Assign the majority class of the k-nearest neighbors.

**Objective:** Classification or regression based on the majority class of nearby instances.

## K-Means Clustering

**Model:** Assign each data point to the cluster whose mean is nearest.

**Objective:** Unsupervised clustering of data points.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Model:** Transform data to a new coordinate system to maximize variance.

**Objective:** Dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

**Model:** Neural network architecture designed for sequences.

**Objective:** Capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.

## Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)

Ensemble of weak learners (usually decision trees).

**Objective:** Combine weak models to create a strong predictive model.
