# Machine Learning Models Overview

Machine learning (ML) involves the use of mathematical models to make predictions or decisions based on data. There are various types of machine learning models, and the choice of model depends on the nature of the problem you are trying to solve. Here are some common mathematical models used in machine learning:

## Linear Regression

**Model:** \(y = mx + b\)  
**Objective:** Predict a continuous output variable (\(y\)) based on one or more input features (\(x\)).

## Logistic Regression

**Model:** \(P(Y=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(mx + b)}}\)  
**Objective:** Binary classification, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to class 1.

## Decision Trees

A tree-like model with nodes representing decisions based on features.  
**Objective:** Classification or regression based on a series of decisions.

## Random Forest

Ensemble of decision trees.  
**Objective:** Improve accuracy and control overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Model:** \(f(x) = \langle w, x \rangle + b\)  
**Objective:** Find the hyperplane that
